This policy stems from the “AI for good” initiative by the International Telecommunication Union  \\nand the Sustainable Development Goals set forth  by the United Nat ions.  \\n Considering the disruptive nature of AI and allied technologies and how  it is re -ordering the socio -\\neconomic construct of the world , we desire to live in . Therefore, i t is essential to responsibly harness this \\nopportunity while keeping the interest of a common person foremost. T herefore, t o survive and thrive, \\nPakistan aims to revitalize its resolve toward digitalization , which  will involve processing personal data \\nthrough AI . To this end, the said policy coherently interlaces with the Perso nal Data Protection Act, Pakistan \\nCloud First Policy , and the Digital Pakistan Policy initiatives.  \\n   \\n \\n \\n6 \\n 1 Executive  Summary  \\nPakistan has a unique opportunity to harness digital disruption by educating an eager young population \\nthat can potentially propel the n ation onto a growth trajectory to sustain our future national \\ncompetitiveness and improve the lives of citizens. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the next frontier of \\ntechnological opportunities, and it has been widely proven and understood that the  collection, processing, \\nuse, and exchange of data through automated/intelligent means would drive the entire society into the \\nnext stage of its evolution which is unprecedented and requires a progressive , yet careful approach. So, \\nafter a thorough analysi s of the global perspective and based on the evidence collected through more \\nextensive consultations with the stakeholders, the Ministry of IT & Telecom has come to a much -desired \\nconclusion that it needs to chalk out a developmental roadmap for better, faster and responsible adoption \\nof AI in the country . For that, the policy document is put in place to reap long -term and sustainable benefits \\nfor its people.  \\nThe policy document offers a wide range of developmental initiatives necessary for awareness and \\nadoption, reimagining the transparent and fair use of personal data using AI and stimulating innovation \\nthrough industry -academia collaborations and investments in AI-led initiatives. The National AI Policy is \\ncrafted to focus on the equitable distribution o f opportunity and its responsible use , having the following \\ndefining attributes.  \\n• Evidence -Based and Target Oriented  \\n• User -Centric and Forward -Looking  \\n• Objective and Overarching  \\nThe AI policy further aims to augment AI and allied technologies through balanced demand and supply -\\nside interventions , as briefly described below.   \\n• Market Enablement - Establishment  of research & innovation cent ers in AI for developing, test -\\nbedding, deploying, and scaling AI solutions.  This includes learning how to improve govern ance  \\nand manage the impact of AI.  \\n• Progressive  and Trusted Environment – Responsible  use of AI to generate economic gains and \\nimprove lives. In addition,  AI will raise the Government’s capability to deliver anticipatory and \\npersonali zed services.  \\n• Enabling AI through Awareness and Readiness  - Pakistan shall increase awareness and \\nunderstand ing of AI technologies and the ir benefits ; our workforce will  be equ ipped with the \\nnecessary competencies to participate in the AI economy.  \\n• Transformation & Evolution - Transformation of sectors and industries towards effective use of \\nAI, facilitated by national IT boards through creating awareness and offering training pr ograms \\nthrough sectoral cooperation.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n7 \\n 2 Introduction and Context  \\n2.1 Why Pakistan Needs AI Policy  \\nThe need for National AI Policy is to create a broad -based  awareness of the use of AI -based platforms while \\nkeeping privacy  at the forefront, upskilling human capital on AI and allied technologies, guid ing investment \\nin AI research and development, ensur ing ethical and responsible use of AI, and provide a framework for \\naddressing the challenges and risks associated with the socio -economic outfit  of the country . \\nThe AI policy covers the following  key areas, including:  \\n• Investment in Research and Development  Infrastructure : Pakistan  should invest in research and \\ndevelopment to build in-house  AI capabilities  required for application development based on local \\ndata . This investment should include funding for establishing research organizations that have a \\nsustainable mandate of basic research, data standardization, providing support to the government \\nfor regul atory and legal interventions regarding AI, maintaining a central computational \\ninfrastructure , data storage facilities , and partnerships with universities and research institutions \\nboth domestically and internationally.  This investment should also include  training programs to \\nbuild the necessary technical expertise . The AI policy outlines how Pakistan must  collaborate with \\nother countries to share best practices and expertise in AI.  \\n• Ethical and Responsible Use: The AI policy proposed the establishment of an AI regulatory \\ndirectorate that ensures  the ethical and responsible use of AI. This includes ensuring that AI is not \\nused to discriminate against individuals or groups and that its use is transparent and accountable.  \\n• Job Displacement: The AI policy addres ses the potential job displacement that could result from \\nthe global proliferation  of AI. This includes investing in training programs to help existing and new \\nworkforce  acquire the skills to adapt to changing job requirements.  \\n• AI can help to promote econo mic growth by encouraging investment in AI research and \\ndevelopment. This investment can lead to the creation of new jobs and industries, as well as \\nimproved productivity and efficiency.  \\n• AI policy can help  address social and economic challenges by  improving healthcare outcomes, \\nproviding  better access to education, and addressing food security challenges.  \\n• AI policy can help ensure that AI\\'s benefits  are shared equitably across society. This includes \\naddressing issues such as bias and discrimination  and ensuring that the benefits of AI are not \\nconcentrated in the hands of a few.  \\n2.2 The State of AI in Pakistan  \\nPakistan has a population of 224 million  as of 2022  and is predicted  to reach 338 million  by 2050 [2], with \\na current  literacy rate of around 62.3 % [3]. Moreover,  Pakistan is considered the fifth largest country in the \\nworld  in terms of the young population ; 64% of the nation is younger than 30 [4]. With such a propelling \\nnumber of employable human capital,  we have enormous development potential  on one end and a \\ntremendous responsibility  on the other . Nevertheless, d espite all the odds,  Pakistan has been able to \\nregister  notable efforts  through public/private interventions as follows : \\n• Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence & Computing ( PIAIC ) \\n• Center for Artificial Intelligence and Computing ( CENTAIC)  \\n• National Center of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI)   \\n• Sino -Pak Center for Artificial Intelligence  (SPCAI)  \\nThese  timely  initiatives have performed well in their domains and need continuity to achieve long -term \\ntargets. To achieve  the AI-accelerated  socio -economic development urgently required by Pakistan and its \\nactual impact on the GDP of the country , a national strategy for AI adoption is critical . The AI policy provides \\na holistic structure , by the societal challenges regarding AI adoption can be addressed by establishing the \\nnecessary  ecosystem with specialized initiatives  and organizational responsibilities. The policy proposes \\nthe National AI fund as a perpetual and central fund to support the proposed interventions .   \\n \\n \\n8 \\n 3 Vision, Scope & Objectives  \\n3.1 Vision  \\nOwing to the impact of AI globally and its local adoption and implications, the Government of Pakistan \\nenvisions : \\n“To Embrace AI by appreciating Human Intelligence and stimulating a Hybrid Intelligence \\necosystem for equitable, responsible, and transparent use of AI .” \\n3.2 Scope  \\nThe policy framework is envisaged to provide a  complete  AI-enabling ecosystem in Pakistan , covering all \\naspect s of awareness , skill development , standardization,  and ethical  use. \\n3.3 Objectives  \\nHere the strategic objectives are distributed into two societal agendas of development and responsibility \\nto efficiently evolve the society in the age of the fourth industrial revolution:  \\nDevelopmental Agenda  \\n(Embracing AI) Responsibility Agenda  \\n(Appreciating Human Intelligence)  \\nTraining and upskilling human capital in AI at all \\nlevels to address  the needs and demands of the \\nmarket efficiently.  \\nIntegrat ing AI in to the National Curriculums at all \\nlevels is essential  from a necessity , application , and \\nuse standpoint.  Ensure the ethical use of AI through inclusive and \\nforward -looking guidelines.  \\n \\nIncreasing public awareness to facilitate the \\nadoption of AI sustainably . Provide an enabling platform for AI with appropriate \\nsandbox and agile regulatory  arrangements to \\naddress  societal and regulatory challenges  (only \\nwhere necessary) . \\nTo embrace resea rch and innovation -based culture, \\noffer fiscal/non -fiscal incentives to start -ups/SMEs \\ninvesting in AI -based services/technologies . Define data standards and invest in computational \\nresources for the responsible use of organized \\ndatasets.  \\n Strengthen international collaboration with both \\nacademia and industry . \\n3.4 Policy Drivers and Targets  \\nThe policy drivers help navigate th e identified gaps and challenges by orchestrating a journey -based \\napproach comprising four defining pillars of development and responsibility, complimented by progressive \\ntargets for effective policy implementation . \\n3.4.1  The Drivers  \\nThrough the challenges and gaps, the policy lays a fundamental framework driven through a pillar -based \\napproach driven through the developm ental journey of AI adoption and proliferation using agile and all -\\ninclusive models incrementally. These drivers are:   \\n \\n \\n9 \\n 3.4.1.1  1st Pillar: Enabling AI through Awareness and Readiness  \\nThe first pillar will focus on societal preparation in becoming increasingly aware  of the potential benefits \\nof AI, deployment requirements, and adopting measures for establishing readiness towards AI adoption. \\nTargeted interventions achieve this in meeting the societal gaps. The interventions include awareness \\nproliferation programs re lated to AI, improving the quality of R&D in AI through applied research, and \\nfurther enhancing the footprint in AI through fiscal/logistical support, curriculum development, and review \\nof existing coursework to make it more relevant to global demand and b est practices. Furthermore, the \\nupskilling of the current workforce shall be done through bootcamps and high -impact short courses using \\nMassive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) Platforms. The initiative aims to meet the societal gaps of \\nAwareness and Adaptation  Challenges (G1).  \\n3.4.1.2  2nd Pillar: AI Market Enablement   \\nThe second pillar will help organize matters related to establishing an ecosystem to facilitate the \\ndevelopment and deployment of AI. This includes steps taken to address the identified societal challenge s, \\nincluding Awareness and Adaptation Challenges  (G1), Data Standardization and Accessibility (G 2), and \\nComputational Needs (G 3). \\n3.4.1.3  3rd Pillar: Building Progressive & Trusted Environment   \\nThe third pillar focuses on the interventions necessary for building a progressive and trusted environment \\nwhere the personal data of citizens and the data of organizations are protected. This section addresses \\nAwareness and Adaptation Challenges (G1) and Ethical Challenges (G4)  to ensure the safe and responsible \\nuse of AI and associated technologies.  \\n3.4.1.4  4th Pillar: Transformation & Evolution   \\nThis pillar focuses on developing roadmaps for each sector of society, including governance , so the \\nnecessary evoluti on toward AI adoption can be achieved. During the process, several interventions are \\nhighlighted to facilitate this transformation, including industrial transformation and sandboxing. In \\naddition, t his driver will assist us in addressing awareness and adap tation challenges  (G1)  and Data \\nStandardization and Accessibility (G 2).  \\n3.4.2  The National AI Targets  \\nNavigating through the policy drivers, the National AI Targets reflect the needs and concerns which will be \\naddressed through subsequent policy interventions with a definite yet simple approach presenting a \\nbandwagon of tangible opportunities having the following attributes:  \\na. The proposed targets are highly focused and inclusive.  \\nb. The said targets are simple, realistic, and achievable.  \\nc. The targets o ffer a reasonable amount of time for its initiation and achieving desired results with \\nimpact registration.  \\nd. The offered targets can be reviewed quantifiably.  \\ne. As explained later in the document, special consideration is given to agility for implementing \\ndifferent programs, so a holistic approach toward AI adoption could be exercised.  \\nf. The targets are based on the international developmental Agenda for AI and best practices, which \\nwill allow recognition of Pakistan on the global front.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\n \\n10 \\n \\n                           \\nS.No.  Pillar Target  Description  Current State  Desired State  Timeline  \\n1.  Enabling AI \\nthrough \\nAwareness & \\nReadiness  Target -1 \\n Public Awareness \\nof AI & Allied \\nTechnologies  \\n The level of awareness regarding AI and its \\npotential applications for socio -economic \\ndevelopment by addressing societal \\nchallenges is considerably low.  \\n A comprehensive program regarding p ublic \\nawareness of AI & allied technologies  shall be \\nundertaken at  the national level to achieve a \\nwidespread awareness of 90%  of the public \\nwith internet access. This program under CoE -\\nAI shall undertake curriculum revision at all \\nlevels of education, training of the existing \\nworkforce, and specialized programs for \\nmarginalized women and PWDs.  By 2026  \\n \\nTarget -2 Developing new \\nskilled human \\ncapital and \\nupskilling the \\nexisting workforce  Less than 10% of the current workforce \\nworking in  computing and IT is skilled in AI \\nand Allied Technologies [Survey conducted \\nby MoITT in 2022].  The aim is to train 1 million new and existing \\nresources IT graduates in high -impact  applied \\nskills in AI and Allied Technologies by using \\nsustainable models fo r imparting education. \\nTo achieve this, at least 10,000 new trainers \\nwill be required to impart high -impact AI & \\nAllied Technologies education.  \\nGoal: 1M trained in AI, 10k new trainers  By 2027  \\n \\nOpportunities for \\non-job training for \\napplied skillset  Currently, there are limited programs for \\non-job training of IT professionals offered by \\nthe government of Pakistan.  A program regarding on -job training needs to \\nbe initiated to offer incentives for the on -job \\ntraining, especially for IT -certified /graduate \\nprofessionals annually.  The goal is to equip at \\nleast 60% of IT graduates specializing  in the \\nlatest technologies annually . By 2025  \\nHigher Education \\nScholarships  Currently, HEC, in partnership with friendly \\ncountries, offers scholarships to students for \\npost -graduate and doctoral studies locally \\nand abroad with a limited focus on AI.  A separate fund shall increase the \\nscholarships in AI and allied technologies by \\n30% of the total scholarships offered annually \\nby HEC in partnership with industry and \\ninternational partners.  By 2026   \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\nAwareness and \\nupskilling in the \\npublic sector  Currently, no programs/initiatives focus on \\nthe awareness and upskilling of civil \\nservants and the public sector in AI and its \\napplications.  To develop an awareness of applied AI for all \\nGrade 12 to Grade 22 employees, including \\ntechnocrats and other allied staff working in \\ndifferent departments and institutions at \\nfederal and provincia l levels.  \\nIntroduce a skill development drive for public \\nsector employees in AI and Allied \\nTechnologies with a target to train at least \\n70% of existing employees working in the IT \\nand AI potential sectors and 100% of new \\ninductees.  By 2026  \\nTarget -3 \\n R&D initiatives in AI \\nand allied \\ntechnologies  Currently, there is limited funding for \\nAI/ML/DL -led R&D initiatives in academia \\nand the industry through available Funding \\nChannels organized by the public sector.  This approach shall be bifurcated.  Firstly, an \\nR&D focus targeting national AI initiatives \\nwith short - and long -term tangible \\ndeliverables shall be initiated. Secondly, at \\nleast 1,000 AI -led R&D initiatives shall be \\nfunded in academia and the private sector via \\nfiscal and non -fiscal suppor t.

These \\nreports shall be presented to NAIF BoD for review and decision -making.  \\n4.1.3  Catalyzing Social Development through AI  by National Initiatives  \\nFrom a global perspective of service/technology adoption, it is witnessed that the social sector usually \\nmisses out on the early adoption of cutting -edge technologies such as AI due to its magnitude, lack of \\ncoherence , and service complexities. On the contra ry, the sectorial  approach is swift but in siloes, and \\ntherefore, desired performance targets are challenging. The Government of Pakistan is aware of data \\norchestration and management issues in the social sector. Due to these challenges, a National \\ndevelop mental drive via focused national projects is necessitated through this initiative by directly \\ninvesting in a handful of priority areas for improving service delivery. Following are the National AI \\nInitiatives that shall be undertaken to bring AI applicati ons in to the mainstream to achieve socio -economic \\ndeliverables and ensure sustainable outcomes.  \\n4.1.3.1   Data Standardization and Aggregation  for Servicification  \\nThe National and Provincial governments possess heterogeneous datasets through various verifiable and \\nunverifiable sources and require orchestration bottom -up for secure and transparent use. Suppose the \\nsocial data is standardized and made available by the private sector for public service provisioning in a \\nstructured environment. In that case, it can help  reduce time to service due to process cluttering and \\nensure seamless application of AI and allied technologies in an integrated manner. Immediate actions \\nrequired in this regard are:  \\nI. The CoE -AI shall organize a common and sectoral data collection and processing mechanism for \\nunstructured, semi -structured, and structured datasets for the data available in the public sector \\nand accessible through market regulators for the private sector.  \\nII. CoE-AI shall undertake the data standardization in t he identified priority social sectors under a \\nCommon Operating Environment (COE) such as  Healthcare, Legal, Public Facilitation Services, \\nEducation, Food Security, and essential Utilities (electricity, gas, drinking water, water, sewage, \\nand cleaning servi ces).  \\nIII. These standards shall be implemented via National/Provincial IT Boards across the country by \\nstandardizing data collection and processing under different Management Information Systems \\noperating in various departments/institutions. Furthermore, the a vailable data should be \\navailable to these National/Provincial IT Boards to develop a standard data exchange system.  \\nIV. In another scenario, where there is yet to be digitized for seamless collection, especially in the \\nidentified social sectors, the National /Provincial IT Boards  in support of CoE-AI, while exercising \\ntheir mandate, shall assist such National/Provincial institutions in digitizing data on the given \\nstandards for early alignment.  \\nV. Under the Cloud First Policy of the Government of Pakistan, althou gh the end -user department \\nshall remain the custodian of acquired data, a copy of such data public data must be hosted on \\nthe National Telecom Corporation (NTC) cloud infrastructure nationwide. Moreover,  \\n \\n \\n4 \\n National/Provincial IT Boards shall act as controlle rs and processors of such data while assisting \\nthe concerned department(s) in secure and effective service provisioning.  \\nVI. All such data shall be well backed up on the industry’s best practices and made available in a \\ncontrolled environment to CoE -AI to acce ss and use to develop different AI algorithms for \\ndata/system integrations and intelligent service offerings through prescribed processes with \\nincremental value addition.  \\nVII. Such AI algorithms shall be made available to the private sector entities for sector ial sandboxing \\nand subsequent service provisioning while always remaining compliant with the sandbox and \\navailable for system/service audit.  \\nVIII. Smart city-based  projects are already in the deployment phase in several cities in Pakistan. CoE -\\nAI shall support i n indigenization of computer vision technology by standardization targeting high \\naccuracy of person and object detection. Computer Vision -based surveillance application  poses \\nsignificant potential to contribut e to the safety of citizens. Therefore, C oE-AI shall accelerate the \\ntechnology rollout to even smaller cities in Pakistan.  \\nAll the identified institutions in clause vide 4.1.3.1  (I-VIII) above are hereby directed based on constitutional \\nstipulations to work coherently to solve citizens\\' problems and always offer data to CoE -AI for AI -based \\nservice and analytical transformation.  \\n4.1.3.2  National Health Services  Transformation using AI  \\nThis program aims to help prevent and better manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood \\npressure, and hi gh cholesterol, to reduce the risk of complications like heart disease, stroke, and kidney \\nfailure. Many Pakistanis have chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol. \\nThey may be unaware of these conditions as the symptoms ma y not be noticeable early on. However, these \\ndiseases can lead to severe complications such as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and even death if not \\nwell controlled. Similarly, one of the biggest challenges in AI proliferation in the healthcare secto r is the \\ndigitization of a massive volume of data available in hospitals and health institutes in hardcopies. However, \\neven if the data is digitized in some institutes and hospitals, it is not standardized, and that hinders the \\naccessibility of data and ev entual processing.   \\nI. CoE-AI shall support the Ministry of National Health Services Regulation and Coordination in better \\ncontrol ling chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol. CoE-AI \\nshall develop guidelines for h ealthcare providers to become  more productive and help patients \\ncontrol chronic disease conditions  using the latest AI technology . \\nII. AI can analyze clinical data, medical images, health behavio rs, and genomic data to create a \\ncustomized individual risk score . This sco re can help individuals take appropriate preventive \\nmeasures and receive earlier and more targeted interventions from their care teams. Patients at \\nhigher risk of complications can be  identified earlier and provided with more intensive \\nmanagement and monitoring in the primary care setting to reduce the likelihood of medical \\ncomplications.  CoE-AI shall establish working groups with the Ministry of National Health Services \\nRegulation and Coordination  to establish the framework of medical data standardiza tion along \\nwith the relevant organizations.  \\nIII. AI can support primary care doctors and care teams in developing personalized care plans \\nconsidering a patient’s risk profile. As each care team may look after many patients, AI can also \\nassist in monitoring the  progress and alert care teams to patients whose progress shows cause for \\nconcern to take timely action.  CoE-AI shall actively develop and support such initiatives.  \\nIV. AI can make it easier for patients to self -manage their conditions. For example, patients c an use AI \\nto monitor their health status and receive timely reminders to eat healthily, increase physical  \\n \\n \\n5 \\n activit y, take medication, and report for check -ups. As a result, c itizens will enjoy improved health \\noutcomes and be empowered to better self -manage chronic diseases.  CoE-AI shall support the \\nindigenization of AI products for personal healthcare.  \\nV. CoE-AI shall undertake the d igitalization of medical data and its management . It would  help \\nmaintain patients’ histor ies, which can be invaluable in precision  medicine and R&D.  \\n4.1.3.3  Intelligent Learning and Assessment  using AI  \\nEvery individual in society has a different capacity to comprehend and retain new information and level of \\nskill in a particular trade. Also, they have different aptitudes and learning needs. Therefore, teachers cannot \\npersonalize every individual ’s learning experience, especially in the subjects where a particular skill is to be \\ntaught.  The following points discuss the prospects of AI applications:  \\nI. CoE-AI shall develop a comprehensive program to provide a personalized learning and assessment \\nmechanism by imparting AI -based adaptive skill assessment and training based on a modern \\ncurriculum. A ll these activities shall be organized in public -private partnerships . The progr am shall \\nbe manag ed through existing institutions , while CoE -AI shall only offer guidelines based on market \\nneeds and the latest technological advancements through its team of experts  from the industry \\nand academia .  \\nII. Initially, the program shall be launche d on a pilot basis in all the public institutions in the Federal \\nCapital ; however, upon the program\\'s outcomes  and with necessary pivots and iterations, the \\nprogram shall be spread nationwide , ensuring authenticity and transparency  of the trained \\nresources . \\n4.1.3.4  National IoT Data Cluster  \\nThe main challenge for the successful implementation of IoT Cloud -based services is the availability of data \\nin digital form and the standardization of the data. Unfortunately, Pakistan’s government and public \\norganizations are  sitting on vast amounts of data that have yet to be digitalized and then standardized so \\nthat it can be used in predictive analytics, Machine Learning/Deep Learning, and other technological uses.  \\nThe following points discuss the prospects of AI applicatio ns:  \\nI. CoE-AI shall establish  IoT cloud -based services at subsidized rates. It will offer a faster learning \\nexperience and support for academia.  \\nII. CoE-AI shall p romote IoT -based applications. Improve the quality of Cloud and IoT -based \\ntechnologies and will pro vide state -of-the-art facilities for predictive analytics and the generation \\nof insights for various industries.  \\nIII. The initiative shall invite local and international companies to provide IoT -based Cloud services on \\ncompetitive grounds.  \\n4.1.3.5  Agriculture Supply Chain Optimization  \\nThe biggest challenge in the agricultural sector regarding  supply chain optimization is data digitization and \\nstandardization. Accessibility is another challenge that can only be addressed after digitization and \\nstanda rdization of available data. Therefore, to fuel Big Data Analytics, vital for any supply chain \\nmanagement and inventory management systems to be provided with standardized data.  The following \\npoints discuss the prospects of AI applications:  \\nI. The initiative under CoE -AI shall  provide predictive analytics for streamlining the supply and \\ndemand of the agricultural supply chain, which will assist in streamlining supply and demand \\nmechanisms through predictive analytics. In addition, it will help in reducing wast age by optimizing \\nthe inventory management system.  \\nII. It will e stablish weather prediction systems to assist farmers in making informed decisions based \\non weather predictions about the cultivation and harvest of crops.   \\n \\n \\n6 \\n III. The program shall e mploy IoTs and sensor  technology for soil monitoring systems.  \\n4.1.3.6  E-Khidmat Centers 2.0  \\nPublic services are high -volume and resource -intensive, including varied domains such as healthcare, \\neducation, sanitation, energy, security, and other government services. Delayed or substand ard services \\nprovided to the public are common complaints shared by the public over time . Such delays are \\ncounterproductive to the smooth running of daily life in cities. The following points discuss the prospects \\nof AI applications:  \\nI. CoE-AI shall undertake  the d evelopment of a smart citizen portal to streamline the delivery of \\nmunicipal services  that shall provide better customer service quality . \\nII. Smart reporting of routine issues the citizens face a ssist s government departments in becoming  \\nmore efficient . \\nIII. Centralized service delivery shall automate the regular paperwork and  reduce the employee \\nburden  and associated expenses. It will also lead to the d igitaliz ation of  public records . \\nIV. Chatbots will provide citizens with a quick response mechanism and improve t he quality of the \\nservices . \\n4.1.3.7  Weather Prediction and Analysis  using AI  \\nAvailability of data and its standardization is the fundamental issue that may hinder the utilization of \\ncentralized weather and solar irradiance prediction for better weather predictions . The following points \\ndiscuss the prospects of AI applications:  \\nI. Division of the geographic span of the country into regions based on similar microclimates and \\ntraining machine learning models for accurate prediction. This shall help prepare aga inst calamities \\nand agricultural operations.  CoE-AI shall undertake this initiative with the Ministry of Climate \\nChange and  the Pakistan Meteorological Department . \\nII. This program shall p rovide the facility as a web service hosted on a local cloud at the national level  \\nso that it can be used to boost  renewable energy solutions and assist national energy management \\ncompanies in their operations.  \\n4.1.3.8  Intelligent Communications Systems (Road/Rail/Air)  \\nMobility is a significant challenge in Pakistan and impacts al l the sectors contributing to the GDP. AI can be \\none of the essential  tools t o facilitate passenger mobility, revenue management, traffic planning , and \\nmanagement and transport policy. CoE-AI shall develop a program to make the best use of the following \\nprospects of AI applications:  \\nI. Predicting  commuters ’ behavio r at micro -market levels to optimize the availability of \\ntransport ation  and maximize revenue growth.  \\nII. Use AI to assess the affordability and accessibility of commuters to provide mobility services.  \\nIII. Assess the future demographics of the society to plan the resources timely and assist in developing \\nstrategies and programs to help the government achieve social, economic, and environmental \\nobjectives using Railways.  \\nIV. Assess the r ehabilitation and constructi on of major bridges  with preventive maintenance \\napplications.  \\nV. AI-based platforms can assist the aviation industry in flight management by receiving real -time \\ndata from multiple sensors and external sources to optimize flight paths. This will help the pilot s \\nand dispatchers make informed decisions during the flight concerning optimal route choices, \\nreduce delays due to bad weather conditions and turbulence, etc.   \\n \\n \\n7 \\n AI can play a critical role in reducing road accidents by analyzing the crash data available, pr oviding insights \\nto avert collisions, and enhancing the response after the accidents. Besides autonomous cars that are now \\na reality, AI applications fuel lane -keeping systems, emergency brakes, and auto -parking systems.  \\n4.1.4  Data and Computational Infrastructu re \\nThis initiative includes standardizing the data of  State -Owned Enterprises (SoEs), Boards , and Civil \\nAuthorities  for applying artificial Intelligence based Algorithms ensuring seamless service provisioning and \\nanalytics .

The program shall be organized on a continuous basis  and be funded by CoE -AI, HEC, the private \\nsector , international donors , and financial institutions  equitably , considering  the domestic/global \\ndemand.   \\nIV. Public Sector Awareness & Upskilling  \\na. The CoE -AI shall formulate a curriculum to increase  public servants\\' awareness of Personal Data \\nProtection and AI . The curriculum shall sensitize the target audience on how AI can  impact  \\ndecision -making and why access to data should be offered to the private sector and academia to \\nimprove productivity and user experience concerning public services through behavioral  and \\npredictive analytics.   \\n \\n \\n10 \\n b.  The curriculum shall be or ganized in consultation with the Establishment Division for inclusion in \\nthe coursework of the public servants and implementation at different levels.  \\nc. 100% of public servants shall gain awareness and knowledge on personal data protection and AI \\nby 2025 to effectively implement  the guidelines and directives in their respective departments.  \\n4.2.2  Research  and Development  \\nAccording to the World Bank country -wise R&D expenditure report , the global average of R&D expenditure \\nwith respect to GDP is 2.63% . In contrast,  Pakistan\\'s industrial sector R&D spending  is as low as 0.2% of the \\nGDP. This distrust of the industry in academia\\'s research and development abilities  needs handholding , \\nespecially in the preferential adoption of high -tech products/services resea rched and developed \\nindigenously.   \\nI. R&D Projects in AI and Allied Technologies  \\na. While acting as the hub for research and development, the CoE -AI shall organize a special grant \\nfor supporting R&D projects using AI and allied technologies in academia and the p rivate \\nsector.  \\nb. Such projects shall be attributed to solving socio -economic, civic , and user behavio ral issues \\nand opportunities with preference to the identified priority sectors in this policy.  \\nc. At least 400 projects shall be enabled through fiscal and logistical support of up  to PKR 1 million \\nper project  or any other agreed amount  on the prescribed criterion .  \\nd. The purpose of such funding shall solely be to offer essential  support to the level of \\nprototyping and tak e it to the level that it becomes commercially viable for raising \\ninvestments . \\nII.

The CoE -AI shall aim to facilitate the registration of at  least 400 patents in high -tech for \\nacademia and the private  sector annually .   \\n4.2.3  Algorithms, Data Science  & AI in Basic Education  \\nI. Where the policy document emphasizes the funda mental  understanding and awareness of \\npersonal data protection and AI, it also aims to stimulate  an incremental impact of AI on society \\nright from the grassroots . Therefore, the policy has given equal importance to teach ing algorithms, \\ndata science , and AI in basic STEM education . In this regard, it stipulates that. CoE-AI shall  hire a \\nlocal/international consultant with expertise in high -tech curriculum development to develop a \\nNational Curriculum in Algorithms, Data Sciences, AI , and Allied Technologies from the sixth to the  \\ntwelfth standard.   \\n \\n \\n11 \\n II. The Consultant shall develop the National Curriculum based on best practices within six (6) \\nmonths, along with its adoption strategy , and present the working draft for further consultation \\nto CoE-AI. \\nIII. CoE-AI, in consultation with the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training , shall \\norganize a working committee comprising STEM education experts from the industry and abroad, \\nthe local educational boards for middle /high schools , and the association of schools  for reviewing \\nthe National High -Tech Curriculum Draft and its adoption strategy  and propose their \\nrecommendations on it within three months of its first presentation.  \\nIV. The draft shall then be finalized and translated in to local la nguages before its adoption and  made \\navailable to relevant institutions within six (6) months of draft finalization.  \\n4.2.4  Skill Development of Marginalized  Women & PWDs  \\nWomen make  up 49% of the total population in Pakistan and possess equal rights for access to  learning \\nand earning opportunities in any field and walk of life. This  is the case with Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). \\nWith high -speed broadband access nationwide and sufficient learning avenues, the cultural and religious \\nbarriers can easily be mitiga ted without complain ts. \\nOwing to the preferential approach of the Government of Pakistan in Digital Pakistan \\'s drive towards a \\ndigital economy, the following interventions are necessary for the marginalized sections of society . \\nI. As part of the  National High -Impact Skill Development Program, the CoE -AI shall organize an \\noffshoot of the same , aiming to engage marginalized women and PWDs through special \\ncoursework and means of imparting education.  \\nII. The program shall be executed through institutions  such as Bait-ul-Maal, Ehsaas Program , and \\nother institutions with access to marginalized  sections  of women and PWDs.  \\nIII. The program shall also be proliferated using the DigiSkills.pk platform for maximum inclusivity \\nnationwide . Furthermore, a  special quota f or marginalized women and PWDs shall be ensured in \\neach cohort.  \\nIV. CoE-AI shall closely monitor and evaluate the program against set targets via periodic studies for \\nimpact assessment and make necessary provisions to ensure all access  to all  sustainably . \\n4.3 3rd Pillar: Building Progressive & Trusted Environment  \\n4.3.1  Regulating to Accelerate Socio -Economic Adoption  \\nHuman rights, data privacy, values , and responsible use of AI -based technologies is the trending issue \\nworldwide. I nternational governments are seriously  addressing  these issues through legal and regulatory \\ninstruments, devising frameworks accordingly. Such legal and regulat ory frameworks are needed to ensure \\nsafe and secure data -sharing mechanisms formulated considering best international practic es.  \\nI. An AI Regulatory Directorate (ARD)  shall be constituted under the National Commission for \\nPersonal Data Protection (NCPDP) , invoking function (i) of 33.2 from the PDPA Act that call s for \\nmonitoring of technological developments and commercial practice s. It may affect p ersonal \\nprotection  data and promot e measures and undertaking research for innovation in personal data \\nprotection.  \\nII. The key areas of responsibility for the proposed AI Regulatory Directorate (ARD) under the \\nNational Commission for Personal  Data Protection (NCPDP) will be to augment the development \\nof AI -based initiatives through need -based assessment of regulating different functions automated \\nusing AI and the type of data being created and processed for defined purposes. This will be \\nachie ved through implementing the policy directives and other needs as prescribed through \\nregulatory best practices in consultation with stakeholders from time to time. In addition, unique \\nalgorithms and programs would be regulated through a sandbox approach, f or which the  \\n \\n \\n12 \\n Directorate will organize an agile regulatory mechanism to support the overall objectives of \\nNCPDP. It will also assist NCPDP in defining different regulatory functions concerning digital trust \\nat the data creation and processing level.  \\nIII. The A RD will oversee the operations automated by AI, the potential role of AI agents undertaking \\nroles of the data controller and data processor that may affect the rules and regulation s under the \\nPDPA Act . In addition, i t will provide  advisory services to regu late data in use in line with the scope \\nof NCPDP.  \\nIV. The ARD will provide regulatory support regarding AI policy issues like using AI -based doctors’ \\nassistants in hospitals, indirect AI policy issues like intellectual property laws, and relevant AI policy \\nissues like education, urban planning, and welfare policies, among other things.  \\nV. The ARD will provide regulatory support for direct AI policy issues like using AI -based doctors’ \\nassistants in hospitals, indirect AI policy issues like intellectual property law s, and relevant AI policy \\nissues like education, urban planning, and welfare policies, among other things. Undoubtedly, \\nsome of these technologies can make life simpler, but they also have significant drawbacks. \\nSometimes these issues arise because of AI a pplications’ flaws, such as when AI systems develop \\ndiscriminating prejudices. As illustrated by the growing privacy danger posed by pattern \\nrecognition applications, concerns might occur when AI performs its job much too well. Some AI \\nimplementations are morally dubious, possibly harmful (e.g., autonomous kill choices by \\nmachines), or pose more significant systemic issues (e.g., labor displacement through AI, \\nimpingement of existing ethical, legal, and social paradigms). As a result, national attempts to b uild \\nAI policy should be coordinated and backed by a regulatory framework to prevent the hazards \\nassociated with AI’s widespread use.  \\nVI. Design policies in close interaction with the other stakeholders to promote a vibrant research and \\nentrepreneurship ecosystem for innovative AI applications that naturally align with our national \\ninterest.  \\nVII. Develop strategies for attracting our top AI talent from all over the world back to the country, easy \\nyet well -regulated data access to facilitate in novation, and policies to encourage the integration \\nof locally developed AI solutions.  \\nVIII. ARD should develop guidelines for data sharing that encourage entities with data to share it and \\nclarify the best practices for doing so. In addition, the guidelines sho uld spell out the obligations \\nof the data receiver. For government entities, these guidelines can be elevated to mandatory \\npolicies.  \\nIX. Develop regulation policies and standards for data -sharing among countries and lead multilateral \\ndiplomatic efforts to arra nge such agreements.  \\nX. Encourage local businesses to embrace new AI solutions and provide them with a platform for \\ntechnical support and some incentives and regulations. Moreover, it should catalyze the creation \\nof new businesses based on AI technology throu gh start -up funds and incubation centers . \\nXI. Formulate policies to develop and maintain highly resilient cutting -edge computing, storage, and \\nconnectivity infrastructure.  \\nXII. Participate in international efforts to bring standardization in all aspects of AI, e.g. , data formats, \\nnetwork and systems architecture, data , application integration protocols, requirements on test \\ncases, and services.  \\nXIII. Develop a data -sharing framework  and use AI algorithms consistent with social, cultural, and \\nreligious norms and internatio nal guidelines.  \\nXIV. A governance mechanism that will facilitate fairness, data privacy, ethical values control, and \\nalgorithmic accountability will be implemented to support reliability in AI studies.   \\n \\n \\n13 \\n XV. Scientific research and awareness of the effects and risks of AI technologies and systems on the \\nsocio -economic structure will be increased.  \\nXVI. If any AI -generated decision results in an unwarranted outcome, there should be a mechanism to \\nascertain the cause.  \\nXVII. Definition criteria should be set on the responsibi lities shared between individual users, \\norganizations deploying the robots, and the organizations manufacturing them.  \\nXVIII. People should have the right to access, manage and control the data they produce and feed it into \\nAI systems for analysis.  \\nXIX. The AI systems  should be developed in alignment with the ideals of human dignity, rights, and \\ncultural norms.  \\nTo achieve the following goals, ARD will work closely with other domain regulators to gain a better \\nunderstanding of the consequences of AI in different domains  and to ensure compliance with their rules. \\nAs a result, the progress achieved in this area because of this effort will promote economic growth  per \\nhuman development needs while  safeguarding fundamental human rights. Furthermore, ARD will hire a \\nthink tank  of technocrats and industry experts to develop strategies for AI integration in government and \\nindustry and train the necessary resources. In addition, ARD will construct non -disclosure agreements for \\ndata collection and access to new applications across various areas. It will also closely monitor its activities \\nto ensure that data standards and access policies are followed.  \\n4.3.2  Generative AI  \\nGenerative AI is often used to generate text, images, or other types of media that resemble human \\ncreations. Generative  AI has many  potential applications, including art, music, literature, and journalism. \\nHowever, it also raises important ethical and societal questions, particularly around issues such as data \\nprivacy, ownership of content, and the potential for misuse. Th e proposed ARD , along with CoE -AI, shall \\naddress the opportunities and challenges of generative AI in the following ways:  \\n \\nI. Ensuring Ethical Use: Generative AI has the potential to create convincing fake content such as \\ntext, images, and videos.  Therefore,  ARD shall provide regulatory guid elines  to address the \\npossible  spread  of disinformation , data privacy breaches , or fake news.  \\nII. The CoE -AI shall put particular  emphasis on indigenous research innovation with respect to \\nGenerative AI and, in this regard, engage with the OpenAI platform and allocate a special quota \\nfor startups/R&D institutions/companies working in this space.   \\nIII. The CoE -AI shall collaborate with  the Higher Education Commission and Ministry of Science and \\nTechnology to establish best practice s regarding using  generative AI in academia using large \\nlanguage models.  \\nIV. Necessary recommendations shall be made to ARD by CoE -AI for changes in curriculum and ethical \\nuse-related matters for transparent and sustainable use of emerging technologies leading to \\nnecessary amendments in  curriculum and evaluation methods during exams  that address  the \\neducational risks associated with generative AI and m aking its best use in the education .  \\nV. The CoE -AI shall undertake initiatives in developing a pplied research potential at the national level \\nto accelerate the socio -economic adoption of generative AI or similar technologies in the future  \\nand support the sta rtup ecosystem .  \\n4.3.3  Sandboxing for AI Deployment  \\nSandboxes provide several benefits to technology developers, including checking and displaying innovative \\ntechnology in a real -world setting with actual people. Developers and regulators may communicate  \\n \\n \\n14 \\n directl y, creating  a more coherent and cooperative sector. When a new technology obtains market \\nadoption, successive trial -and-error testing in a controlled setting mitigates the risks and unexpected \\neffects, such as undetected security holes. A secondary purpose  of the sandbox is for regulators to have a \\nbetter understanding of the product or service.  This enables regulators to create policies and laws that \\naccommodate, oversee, and govern sectoral innovation inside and outside the sandbox. The most \\nappropriate framework for real -world rules outside the sandbox can be determined by legislation \\nevaluated in the sandbox. In addition, the jurisdiction would become more appealing to technology \\ndevelopers and investors if legislation were updated  and regulatory ambigu ity was removed. The following \\ninterventions are proposed:  \\nI. At least 20  enterprises  should be beneficiar ies of the regulatory sandbox by 2025  to bring an agile \\nand inclusive legal harmonization process through testing and discussion on ethical and legal \\nscenarios . \\nII. At least 50 municipalities across the country will actively use AI -based technologies within the \\nscope of smart city applications  by 2030 to encourage the partic ipation  of these municipalities in \\nAI-enabled applications.  \\n4.3.4  Supporting International Collaboration  \\nInternational collaboration in AI -based research and innovative solutions will complement AI proliferation \\nefforts in Pakistan. The advancement and expertise developed countries enjoy in AI and related \\ntechnologies are still a long -term aspiration for Pakistan ; however, it can benefit from that by collaborating \\nwith international ex perts and institutions in AI and allied technologies. Moreover, t his will help us upgrade \\nour technological infrastructure according to international standards. The proposed intervention for \\nfostering international collaboration is: \\nI. At least five project calls may be launched in AI by 2025 , prioritizing the participation of \\ninter national collaboration . This will provide Pakistan’s academia and industry with fresh \\nperspectives on a new way of working and help them inculcate knowledge about the late st \\ndevelopments in the AI field at the international level.  \\n4.4 4th Pillar: Transformation & Evolution  \\n4.4.1  Role of National IT Boards in Transformation   \\nThe National Information Technology Board (NITB) and provincial IT boards can play a leading role in data \\ndigit ization and standardization in different sectors and industries. Thus, they have a crucial role in AI \\nproliferation and its success. Standardized data is fuel to any AI -based technology, especially Machine \\nLearning/Deep Learning -based technologies trained on the datasets. This makes it a priority task for the IT \\nboards to manage the standardization and accessibility of data. The following interventions are suggested:  \\nI. IT boards should design  and provide roadmaps for the transformations in various sectors and \\nindustries based on the ir awareness and readiness for AI adoption . These roadmaps should start \\ncirculating in the respective sectors by 2023 so that the structural and competency transformation \\ntoward s effective AI adoption in various sectors, especially public institutions , can be expedited.  \\nII. IT boards should become facilitators in designing and providing specialized training courses and \\ncertifications to prepare trained and skilled human capital with skills tailored to  sectoral \\nrequirements . These training programs may be initiated  as early as 2023  to accelerate compliance \\nwith AI adoption needs and requirements and prepare a skilled workforce to bear the  torch of AI \\nadoption and help Pakistan move forward .  \\nIII. AI maturity model and project management guidelines may be imp lemented in at least 50 \\ninstitutions and organizations across the board by 2025 to ensure auditing and accountability \\nstandards per international best practices  implemented for AI -supported platforms.   \\n \\n \\n15 \\n 4.4.2  Industrial Transformation  \\nIndustries are turning any c ountry’s economic wheels, and their optimization help contributes substantially \\nto GDP. AI and allied technologies can augment industries’ capacity building by introducing State -of-the-\\nart technologies such as IoTs and enhancing their efficiency and produc tivity. IoTs streamline assembly \\nlines of automotive industries, assist in asset management in manufacturing plants, improve machine \\nefficiency, and reduce downtime through predictive maintenance. Inventory management is another major \\narea where IoTs help streamline s the whole process, thus reducing wastage and shortages in supply and \\ndemand mechanisms. The induction of IoT -based technologies will be productive in terms of quality control \\nwhich is done by collecting data through thermal and video sensors th roughout the stages of the product \\ncycle. Smart meters powered by IoTs can monitor and optimize the consumption of electricity, water, and \\nother fuels and help establish sustainable usage of valuable energy resources.  \\nI. As an intervention, the Federation of  Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) shall \\npromulgate awareness campaigns to enable local industr ies to embrace AI and allied  technologies  \\nthrough seminars , workshops,  and training courses . This will assist in expediting AI proliferation in \\nindustries and improve industry stakeholders ’ awareness of IoT -based technologie s. \\nII. Data standardization is the key to the success of AI adoption in any capacity . It will provide the raw \\nmaterial in the form of  standardized data sets that will be used to train the AI and allied \\ntechnologies such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning . Especially in the healthcare sector, \\nsharing standardized data will ensure the enablement of the  preventive healthcare system  in \\nPakistan, which has been  adopted worldwide. National Information Technology Board ( NITB) and \\nprovincial boards  are the key  organizations that have an essential  role in ensuring data  \\nstandardization  and providing  accessibility , for the smooth proliferation of AI and related \\ntechnologies , to various sectors and industries of Pakistan.  \\n4.4.3  Public/Private Sector Evolution  \\n COE-AI and ARD need to work in synchronization for a relatively smooth process of AI adoption in the \\npublic and private sectors . They will ensure technical, computational, regulatory, and financial assistance \\nas and when required. Furthermore, the National Artificial Intelligence Fund (NAIF), with help from the \\nprivate sector and international bodies, will fuel the research and inno vative endeavors for successfully \\nintegrating AI and associated technologies into Pakistan’s institutional and industrial fabric. These \\ncollaborative investments will bear fruit in commercializing various products produced by the COE -AI-\\nenabled AI ecosyste m.  \\n5 Policy Implementation & Review  \\nGlobal best practices for policies and strategies solicit the need for an implementation organization that \\nwill not only steer but also help s organize day-to-day operations in line with the directions and timelines \\nstipulated in the policy document.   \\nThis would require a holistic approach through inclusivity of stakeholders at all times and transparency of \\nactions always undertaken with firm monitoring and eva luation . A review and implementation organization \\nshall be orchestrated under the given framework to achieve this . \\n5.1 Steering/Management Committee  \\nI. The steering  committee will comprise government, academia, industry, and civil society members  \\nwith equal repre sentation of each stakeholder .  \\nII.

It will analyze and direct  the progress and performance undertaken by different working groups, \\nthe policy implementation cell , and the organizations  resulting from  policy interventions .   \\n \\n \\n16 \\n IV. The Steering /Management  Committee,  being the apex body and custodian of the policy, will \\nprovide guidelines for new and existing initiatives to the National AI Fund in line with the \\nstipulation s of this policy.  \\n5.2 Working Groups  \\nI. Four working groups will represent  the four policy drivers , with  at least one representation from \\nall stakeholders.  \\nII. It will work in collaboration with international organizations and academia working in similar \\npolicy -making roles to keep the AI Policy updated and based on international best practices.  \\nIII. It will provid e recommendations on adopting  international regulation standard s to the steering \\ncommittee.  \\nIV. These working groups will also assist in the research areas where policy measures are needed to \\npropagate the industries, identify the obstacles, and address them accordingly.  \\nV. Their responsibility will involve monitoring and evaluating their domains and presenting \\nrecommendations to the steering committee.   \\nVI. To monitor and evaluate the operations of various organizations and obtain their input, they will \\nliaise  with institutions such as NAIF and CoE -AI.  \\nVII. They will communicate their recommendations to the steering committee.  \\n5.3 Policy I mplementation Cell  \\nI. The Policy  Implementation Cell will oversee  day-to-day operations  conducted to implement policy \\nguidelines .  \\nII. They will provide operational support to the working groups and management committee for the \\nsmooth running of implementation pr ocesses.  \\nIII. It will work closely with the working groups and the steering committee to monitor the progress \\nof policy implementation and provide ensuing recommendations on a monthly basis for \\nstreamlined policy implementation.  \\nIV. The p olicy Implementation Cell  will be working under the purview of MoITT, report ing to Member \\nIT.  \\n5.4 Review Procedure & Timeline  \\nI.

These areas can socio -\\neconomically benefit the most from AI  adoption and progress by engraining AI technology in its operations.  \\nThe stakeholders in Pakistan are those areas of society with significant potential for AI adoption and where \\nthis technology can lead to substantial progress. The classification of secto rs has been done based on the \\nfollowing criteria, as shown in the figure below.  \\n \\nFigure 1: Criteria for the identification of sectors in society in relevance to AI adoption  \\nThe criteria have led to the identification of the followin g societal areas : \\n1. Agriculture:  AI can revolutionize the agricultural sector by introducing process automation, enhanced \\ntraceability, and analyzing large volumes of data available through satellites and weather predictions. \\nBy 2026, agriculture -based AI technology is expected to reach the $2.5 billion mark.  Agriculture  has a \\nGDP contribution of 20% in Pakistan, a significant portion of our revenue. Therefore, using the latest \\ntechnologies and innovative methods will decrease costs  and improve the quality of yields . \\n2. Healthcare:  The healthcare sector can benefit from AI -based innovations in diagnostics, prevention \\nof outbreaks, research  and development (R&D) in pharmaceuticals, self -monitoring tools, \\npersonalized healthcare, and precision medicine. AI -based technologies have revolutionized \\npreventive medicine as they assist in streamlining patient histories, data standardization, and sha ring \\nmechanisms.  In addition, AI can support attracting the private sector in Pakistan, which only spends \\n1.4% of the country ’s GDP in this sector . \\n3. Manufacturing:  AI and allied technologies such as robotics can revolutionize the manufacturing \\nindustry thro ugh automation and enhanced efficiency of operations and safety at workplaces such as \\nfactories. Pakistan can vastly benefit from AI while developing consumer goods specific to the local \\nmarket requirements.  \\n4. Retail & Commerce:  The retail and commerce indu stry is reaping the fruits of using AI and allied \\ntechnologies with expected AI -based value addition by 2035, touching a whopping figure of $2.23 \\ntrillion. AI and associated technologies can streamline inventory and supply chain management \\nsystems , reducin g wastage and optimizing and enhancing  the efficacy of the entire value chain.  In \\nPakistan, AI -based technologies can significantly  change  retail and commerce , a rapidly emerging \\narea.  \\n5. IT Industry:  The IT  industry is the highest growing sector in the count ry and is also considered  to be \\nat the forefront of the AI revolution worldwide. The IT sector uses  Machin e Learning  and Deep \\nLearning  to re -engineer processes and systems for streamlining business operations and helping them \\n \\n \\n \\n20 \\n leverage new revenue streams and market growth . In addition, AI can supplement the IT industry by \\nmaking its system s more efficient , courtesy of predictive analytic s and Big Data Analytics.  According \\nto statistics, 48% of businesses use Machine Learning , data analy tics, and other AI tools.  IT exports \\nare rapidly growing in Pakistan and have significant potential. Equipping local IT companies with AI \\ninfrastructure an d skilled human capital can help them leverage new and diverse opportunities in the \\nglobal marketspace.  \\n6. Financial Sector:  AI can improve customer experience in the financial sector with enhanced \\ninvestment opportunit y identification. Chatbots provide a smo oth and excellent customer service \\nexperience to clients. Moreover, AI -based technologies and algorithms curb and mitigate fraudulent \\nfinancial activities and augment data safety. AI can improve tax compliance and administration by \\nimproving efficiency thr ough automation and AI -based algorithms.  \\n7. Academia:  AI can assist in teaching and skills development methods. At the global  level, AI adoption \\nleaders have ensured that AI -based curricula become integral to educational institutions to prepare \\nfuture generat ions. Academia and the industry need to collaborate and cooperate, especially in R&D \\nand HR -related initiatives that can assist in the proliferation of AI -based technologies and inculcate \\ninnovative and entrepreneurial thinking in our youth while nurturing  a culture that will expedite AI \\nadoption in various sectors and industries in Pakistan.  \\n8. Government Sector:  Public and government services  can benefit from AI -based technologies and \\nbecome more efficient and productive. For example, automation and chatbot s improve the efficiency \\nand quality of services provided to the public. Similarly, AI can help make complex economic decisions \\nto enhance the productivity of various sectors and industries through accurate predictions.  \\n9. Defense Sector:  The defen se sector of any country showcases the strength of the country’s \\nsovereignty and its ability to defend itself against aggressors. Therefore, every government spends a \\nsubstantial part of its GDP to enhance its defen se capabilities and tries to inculcate the latest \\ntechnologies to strengthen its prowess. AI has brought revolutionary improvements in various \\ndefense  sub-sectors,  particularly in intelligent surveillance system s, automatic drones, geographic \\ntarget detection, autonomous path tracking in missiles, autofocus in tanks and guns, target detection \\nand recognition , and enhanced night vision.  Unfortunately,  Pakistan has faced the worst kind of \\nterrorism for many years. It has caused us irreversible damage with the loss of precious lives of \\ninnocent civilia ns and our armed forces personnel, structural damages, and loss of investors. AI and \\nallied technologies can provide invaluable services in effectively combating terrorism and achieving \\ndefen se targets.  \\n8.2 Survey Statistics  \\nTo assess  the state of AI in Pakist an, the Ministry of IT & Telecom organized a sectorial survey to register  \\nthe evidence nationwide. Error! Reference source not found.  here summarizes the contribution of the \\nparticipating organ izations in the survey. While Error!

AI Readiness  • At the global level, the AI adoption rate is 56% across all geographies, \\nwhile developing markets registered a  21% increase  [5]. • According to a State of AI Report, Pakistan ranks 117 out of 172 countries and has an index \\nscore of 34.03 [6] in terms of AI readiness at a global scale.  \\n2.  AI- Education  • By 2025, 97 million jobs will be opened in AI -based domains such as \\nmachine learning specialists, process automation specialists, big data \\nspecialists , etc. 39% of the companies a im to reskill and develop their \\nworkforce in AI -based technologies  [7].  \\n• There has been an increase in CS  Ph.D. graduates in the US with \\nspecialization in AI/ML and Robotics/Vision categories by 72% and \\n51% , respectively , between 2010 and 2020  [5].  • There are approximately 600,000 people employed in the IT sector with working skills in AI -\\nbased techno logies.  \\n• 25,000 students graduate each year from IT -based programs who are trained in AI and \\nassociated technologies as well [8].  \\n• 47 universities and colleges in Pakistan offer  BS AI, while 9 universities offer  MS AI.  \\n• HEC offers 70 international  Ph.D. admiss ion in IT, CS, Software Engineering, Data Sciences , \\nand AI [9]. \\n3.  Research and \\nDevelopment  • The n umber of AI patents filed in 2021 is 77% which is 30 times more \\nthan in 2015  worldwide.  \\n• AI-based publications  around  the world amounted to 334,497 in \\n2021 [5]. • Pakistani IPO office is not designated/authorized to file IT/AI -based patents. Therefore, most  \\nAI-based patents must  be filed from abroad.  \\n• Between 2016 and 2020, there were 2600 AI -based publications credited to Pakistan [10]. \\n4.  Investment  • More than 40% of large organizations are planning to invest in AI \\ntechnology, according to a survey for 2020.  \\n• In the US alone, AI startups received  over  $20 billion in funds, while \\ncorporate investment in AI has touched the $94 billion mark [5]. • Pakistani Tech -based startups using AI -based technologies received $278 million in funding \\nin 2021 [11]. \\n5.  AI Governance/  \\nRegulations  • 25 countries across the globe have passed 55 AI -related bills; by 2021, \\n18 of those bills have been passed into law [5]. Following l egislative measures have been taken considering Digitization and technological \\nadvancement in Pakistan:  \\n• Personal Data Protection Act  \\n• Digital Pakistan Policy  \\n• Pakistan Cloud Policy  \\n• Pakistan IT Policy  \\n  \\n \\n23 \\n 8.3 Market Challenges  \\nThe evidence furnished above simplifies the identification of challenges leading to pragmatic market \\nsupport and only necessary interventions. These challenges are:  \\n3.2.1.  G1 – Awareness and Adaptation Challenges  \\nI. It is becoming increasingly important that society is aware of the potential of AI in solving routine \\nmatters. This requires an awareness campaign towards controlling and sharing data, basic skills \\neducation, and high -impact skilling at all levels of the c ommunity for sustainable growth. Nations \\ndominating the AI and allied technologies arena have instituted well -defined Human Capital \\ndevelopment and evolution mechanisms to prepare the future generation for AI adoption in \\nvarious sectors through sizable pub lic/private investments and to retain the talent locally. \\nMoreover, international universities have inculcated AI -based curricula in their primary, high -\\nschool, undergraduate, and post -graduate programs to ensure that AI is adopted in a structured \\nmanner o ffering a comprehensive development plan for its role in different phases of life and \\nwork.  \\nII. In Pakistan, enabling AI and allied technologies is challenging without having a basic level of \\nawareness about the technology at the user level. It should be comp lemented with skilled human \\nresources, having a broader understanding of how and where AI should be applied and the best \\npractices in this technology for its effective and responsible use. The major hurdle in preparing AI -\\ntrained human capital is the acces s to data needed to train them in various domains of AI -based \\ntechnologies. Hence, data is the underlying artefact for putting skilled human capital to work and \\nmaking them experiment with using AI -based models in a controlled yet agile environment.   \\nIII. AI a doption would disrupt how work will be done in public and private sectors and various \\nindustries, directly affecting the country ’s socio -economic fabric. People working in traditional \\nways and not skilled in AI -based technologies are at risk of losing thei r jobs if not pivoted timely.  \\nThis issue must  be addressed on a priority basis, which can only be done through awareness and \\nupskilling.  Customized learning programs, workshops, and courses can assist such individuals in \\nsurviving this transition and becom ing an integral part of digitally transformed workplaces.  \\nIV. According to the surveys, at a sectoral scale, half of the respondents are well versed with AI and \\nrelated technologies, while the other half possess working knowledge. To teach an AI-based \\ncurricu lum, the survey findings point to including short courses and 6 -12 month -long boot \\ncamp s/diplomas urgently . Furthermore, bachelor ’s/master’s  level programs and Ph.D.  degrees in \\nAI are also worth considering.  \\nV. The significant adaptation challenges towards A I proliferation include digitization of information, \\ndigital access, literacy, and digital inclusion by design. Heaps of data are available in the public and \\nprivate  sectors , either difficult to access or not available appropriately  (such as in hard copies ). In \\nmany cases, it has been observed that data digitalization and basic process automation in a \\nconfined environment are considered sufficient due to a lack of awareness. Alternatively, Cloud -\\nbased solutions using AI for data/process orchestration, manag ement, and analytics offered as \\nSaaS provides greater access. However, with limited knowledge, such services are never done \\njustice in terms of their utilization. Moreover, in several cases, local SMEs and enterprises are not \\nusing AI and allied technologi es effectively, leading to demand -side paralysis . For instance, \\ndigitizing healthcare -related data is essential in getting patients’ history accessible to the doctors \\nas well as various diagnostic and R&D. Unfortunately, the healthcare sector is digitized at a \\nfundamental level with limited or zero technological transformation  and the standardization of  \\ndata , which is a significant hurdle in enabling AI -based advancement in the healthcare sector.  \\nVI. Digital literacy is another challenge as people are to be educated about data digitization and \\naccessibility and how to adopt safe data -sharing mechanisms. Moreover, it needs to be organized   \\n \\n \\n24 \\n to allow equal opportunity for children, women from remote areas,  and disabled persons to \\nbenefit from the AI proliferation  efforts and meet future challenges .  \\n3.2.2.  G2 – Data Standardization and Accessibility  \\nI. Globally, leaders in AI proliferation have made data standardization and accessibility their top \\npriority. For example, China used the vast datasets available from the provin ces to train AI and \\nallied technologies, especially in the healthcare sector. As a result, it took the burden from the \\nhospitals and medical practitioners. Estonia is another shining example of data standardization \\nand accessibility that enabled the small European country to lead  in AI adoption.  \\nII. Organizations obtain data from several resources . If this data from disparate sources is not brought \\nto a common operating environment , it will create significant problems in its processing for \\ndifferent purposes and uses . Therefore,  Pakistan’s primary issue is to digitize and organize the \\nmassive datasets available in various inaccessible forms  and make them available in a standardized \\nform to make  them  more relevant for data analytics and other data proc essing mechanisms . This \\nis only achievable through sustainable developmental hubs and associated collaborations in \\ndifferent sectors .  \\nIII. Data standardization has been done in the financial sector according to  international standards to \\nretain a competitive e dge. Most companies in the IT industry have also ensured standardization \\nand accessibility. However, as learned through the survey, other sectors such as manufacturing, \\nagriculture, retail & commerce, and healthcare lag significantly in this domain.  Signif icant efforts \\nare required to develop and augment an ecosystem that catalyzes the country’s  adoption of AI and \\nallied technologies . Moreover, the lack of accessibility to data hinders AI -based R&D, predictive \\nanalytics, and various other AI -based technolog ies from producing valuable outputs. It adversely \\naffects advancement in research & development and AI proliferation. The survey results report:  \\na. The l ack of accessibility of data has been pointed out by 86% of the stakeholders, which is a \\nprerequisite to A I adoption in any sector.  \\nb. 50% of the stakeholders shared their concerns about data not being standardized.  \\nc. 71% of respondents consider poor data collection practice s a crippling factor for successful \\nAI adoption.  \\nd. 44% of the stakeholders recommend followin g leaders in AI adoption , such as the UK, \\nEstonia, and China , for data standardization mechanism s. \\n3.2.3.  G3 – Computational Infrastructure Situation and Needs  \\nI. Developed countries and the countries which have made significant progress in AI proliferation \\nhave ens ured the availability of computational equipment and facilities to the stakeholders and \\ninstitutions to train the human capital and streamline the modernization of processes to ensemble \\na sustainable AI outfit.  However, such efforts need resources these co untries have ensured  and \\nmade  available to the relevant stakeholders.  \\nII. Limited computational resources are a shared obstacle by various sectors of Pakistan. The need \\nfor computational facilities is emphasized for providing robust and secure access to infra structure \\nfor complex R&D and high -performing systems. Furthermore, these computational facilities are \\nessential for any initiative to train human resources in AI and allied technologies.  Their availability \\nunder one roof is necessary to streamline the tra ining and learning process.  \\nIII. Similarly, in many cases, the computational resources are not used optimally. Therefore, a \\nnational /provincial data repository of all the public sector data  can be made available to a broader \\naudience  via a secure/controlled ch annel.  There is also a strong need for training on high -\\nperformance computing technologies so that indigenous customized solutions can meet local \\ncomputational requirements within the country.   \\n \\n \\n25 \\n IV. 57% of stakeholders have registered concerns regarding the limi ted availability of computational \\nresources as a barrier to achieving a trained workforce in AI and allied technologies.  \\nV. To augment applied research and provide robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex \\nR&D, computational facilities are consid ered vital by 55% of stakeholders.  \\n3.2.4.  G4 – Ethical Challenges  \\nI. Safe and secure data sharing  and ethical adoption of AI and allied technologies are primary \\nconcerns for every stakeholder, national or international. At a glob al level, various countries that \\nhave  adopted AI formulated guidelines and principles for the ethical use of AI and related \\ntechnologies and established a regulatory framework to streamline safe and secure data -sharing \\nmechanisms. Regulatory challenges must be addressed to establish an enviro nment of trust. \\nMoreover, it is the users’  fundamental right that their data be safe and that their privacy is always \\nupheld. Therefore , an effective regulatory system that may steer  AI adoption, related initiatives, \\nand data -sharing mechanisms  is needed . \\nII. Most stakeholders voted various risks associated with AI adoption medium to high, including \\nmalicious intent, data pollution, Data model theft, fairness, precision deterioration, invasion of \\nprivacy, etc.  \\n   \\n \\n26 \\n 9 References  \\n[1] B.
